# Simple Python Firewall Simulator

## Purpose:
This Python script simulates a basic firewall by defining rules for allowed and blocked IP addresses and ports. It's intended as a learning tool to understand fundamental firewall concepts.

## How it works:
1- Firewall Rules: A dictionary defines rules for allowed IP addresses and ports.
2- Traffic Simulation: The script generates random IP addresses and ports to simulate incoming traffic.
3- Rule Checking: Each simulated packet is checked against the firewall rules.
4- Decision: If the packet matches a rule, it's allowed; otherwise, it's blocked.

## Usage:
1- Run the Python script.<br>
2- The script will continuously simulate network traffic and apply firewall rules.
